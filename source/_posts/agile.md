I have worked remotely as a data science intern for a prospering startup for just over two months. During this time, I was exposed to a fascinating product management system called Agile. Hence, I want to note some things down in case they are relevant in the future. For the sake of confidentiality, I will refer to the startup as "startup-Y".

### What is Agile?

In early 2001, in Snowbird, Utah, 17 people met to discuss the future of software development. The group’s members shared a frustration about the current state of affairs. The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on excessively planning and documenting their software development cycles that they lost sight of what really mattered—pleasing their customers.

Companies may have touted corporate values like “excellence” and “integrity,” but these values did little to guide people—especially software developers—toward a better way.

The Agile Manifesto emerged from this extended weekend at just 68 words, and the short and sweet document went on to change software development forever. [[1]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto)

#### The Agile Manifesto:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
**Responding to change** over following a plan [[2]](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

### Agile vs. Scrum vs. Sprint
These three terms always seem to appear together and intertwined. Below are their meanings/definitions to clear the confusion.

**Agile** (Agile project management): a project management ***philosophy*** or ***framework*** that takes an iterative approach towards the completion of a project. (Mostly for software development projects)

**Scrum**: an Agile ***methodology*** (Some of the most common Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP))

**Sprint**: the core element of Scrum methodology, a consistent time period for developing features for a product, the deliverable of a sprint is a "Done" product increment.
